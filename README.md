# covid-parser

**covid-parser** is an ongoing project by the Bio-NLP group at the University of Washington led by Professor Meliha Yetisgen. 
The goal is to create a sophisticated natural language processing tool suite for identifying COVID diagnostic and testing status, 
as well as signs and symptoms. 

As our work is ongoing, the structure and code within this repo will change rapidly.
